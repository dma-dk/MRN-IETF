# Introduction

   The International Association of Marine Aids to Navigation and
   Lighthouse Authorities (IALA) is a non-profit, international
   technical association in the field of marine aids to navigation.
   Founded in 1957, IALA gathers together authorities, manufacturers,
   consultants, and scientific and training institutes from all over the
   world, offering them the opportunity to exchange and compare their
   experiences and achievements.


Many standardized identification schemes exist for vessels, buoys,
   mariners and other maritime resources already, but there is no single
   system that allows people to specify such an identifier in a uniform
   and unambiguous way.  We believe that it makes sense to introduce a
   naming scheme that can uniquely identify any maritime resource on a
   global scale.

Â 
   A "maritime resource" can be anything that has an identity, including
   organizations, employees, people, physical objects, virtual objects
   (such as electronic documents), buoys, ships, mariners, nautical
   charts and electronic services (e.g., "today's weather report for the
   Oresund Strait").  Of course, not all resources are "retrievable" in
   an electronic sense; human beings, corporations, and buoys would be
   obvious examples.  However, all of these can still be considered
   resources.

   Having a uniform naming scheme will pave the way for new maritime
   digital information services, facilitating innovation, integration,
   trade, safety, and security in the maritime sector.  This document
   defines such a naming system based on Uniform Resource Names (URNs).
