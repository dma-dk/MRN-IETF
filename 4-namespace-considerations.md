# Namespace Considerations

   IALA traditionally addresses the maritime community, but its
   resources are made available to all interested parties. While URN namespaces 
   may exist for which any generic naming system can be encoded. 
   Is is the goal of IALA to foster a community around maritime resource names
   within the global maritime community. Therefore, the possibility of binding 
   to various other namespace repositories have been deemed impractical.
