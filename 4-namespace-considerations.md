# Namespace Considerations

   IALA traditionally addresses the maritime community, but its
   resources are made available to all interested parties.  URN
   namespaces can exist for any generic naming system that needs to be
   encoded.  It is the goal of IALA to foster a community around
   maritime resource names within the global maritime community.
   Therefore, binding to various other namespace repositories has been
   deemed impractical.
