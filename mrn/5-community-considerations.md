# Community Considerations

   Members of the IALA community will benefit from persistent and
   globally unique identifiers for use in software and in conformance
   with protocols developed and used by IALA and third-party
   collaborators.

While in general governing organizations will be free to structure their namespace in any way they see fit. Â It would make sense to create some general guidelines. For example, that every organization should use "organization_name:publications" for their publications.
Or that every identifier that refers to a country uses standards available in ISO 3166 Codes for the representation of names of countries and their subdivisions.


Best practices,
and believe it is best to create our own standard.
