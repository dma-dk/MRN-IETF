# Namespace Considerations

   IALA traditionally addresses the maritime community, but its
   resources are made available to all interested parties.

   There are no additional security considerations other than those
   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general,
   which are described in [@!RFC1737], [@!RFC2141], and [@!RFC3406].

   
   For this reason IALA considers the introduction of a URN namespace
   for its resources as proper action to maintain globally unique,
   persistent and location-independent identifiers based on open
   standards.
   
   
   
URN assignment procedures:
: <br/>The individual URNs shall be assigned through the process of
      development of EBU resources by the European Broadcasting Union
      (EBU).
         
      

      
   
   
      The IPTC acknowledged already the use of URNs during the development
   of its XML based standard "NewsML".  This standard implements the use
   of URNs as unique identifiers for news items as described in "URN
   Namespace for NewsML resources" [RFC3085].

   While developing additional XML based standards as siblings to
   NewsML, IPTC soon got aware that URNs have to be assigned to
   resources that fall beyond the scope of the NewsML namespace.  For
   this reason IPTC developed a new and very general hierarchical
   namespace structure to cover the needs of the currently developed
   standards as well as future standards and to be able to assign URNs
   to resources emanating from them.

   In addition to resources relating directly to its standards, IPTC
   also produces and publishes other documents relevant to the news
   business.  As those resources are used by many organizations outside
   the IPTC membership and therefore could not be considered as internal
   documents IPTC decided to add a branch to the URN hierarchy to be
   assigned to these resources.

RFC 3937                 URN Namespace for IPTC             October 2004


   IPTC maintains global activities and its standards as well as
   resources based on them are used world wide.  Since one focus of the
   activities of IPTC is on global exchange of news any system for
   unique identification of resources has to be considered under global
   aspects.

   For this reason IPTC considers the introduction of a URN namespace
   for its resources as proper action to maintain globally unique,
   persistent and location-independent identifiers based on open
   standards.
