# Community Considerations

   Members of the IALA community will benefit from persistent and
   globally unique identifiers for use in software and in conformance
   with protocols developed and used by IALA and third-party
   collaborators.

   While in general organizations will be free to structure their
   organization specific namespace in any way they see fit (as long as
   they guarantee uniqueness and persistence).  It is our intention to
   provide general guidelines and best practices in the future.  For
   example, encouraging that every organization use "publications" as
   the organization specific namespace id for referring to official
   publications from them.  Or that every identifier that refers to a
   country uses standards available in ISO 3166 for the
   representation of names of countries and their subdivisions.
