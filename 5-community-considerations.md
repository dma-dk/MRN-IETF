# Community Considerations

   Members of the IALA community will benefit from persistent and
   globally unique identifiers for use in software and in conformance
   with protocols developed and used by IALA and third-party
   collaborators.

   Organizations will generally be free to structure their organization-
   specific namespaces in any way they see fit, as long as they
   guarantee uniqueness and persistence.  However, it is our intention
   to also provide general guidelines and best practices in the future.
   One example would be encouraging every organization to use
   "publications" as the organization-specific namespace ID for their
   official publications.  Another might be that every identifier that
   refers to a country use standards available in ISO 3166 for the
   representation of the names of countries and their subdivisions.
