# Introduction

IALA is a non-profit, international technical association founded in 1957. 
It gathers together marine aids to navigation authorities, manufacturers, 
consultants, and, scientific and training institutes from all parts of the world 
and offers them the opportunity to exchange and compare their experiences and 
achievements.

Although a lot of standardized identifier schemes for vessels, buoys, mariners and 
other maritime resources already exist in the maritime world. There is no single system 
that allows people to specify such an identifier in a uniform and unambiguous way.
Â 
We believe that it makes sense to introduce a naming scheme that can uniquely 
identify any maritime resource on a global scale. By maritime resource we more or less  
mean anything that has an identity of some kind. This could be organizations, employees, 
a person, a physical or a virtual object, for instance an electronic document, a buoy, 
a ship, a mariner, a nautical chart or an electronic service (e.g., "today's weather 
report for the Oresund Strait"). Not all resources are "retrievable" in an electronic 
sense; For example, human beings, corporations, and buoys. However, they can still be 
considered a resource.

It is our opinion that having such a naming scheme will facilitate innovation, integration, trade, 
safety, and security in the maritime sector, by paving the way for new kind of maritime 
digital information services.

This document defines such a standard naming system, based on Uniform Resource Names (URNs).
